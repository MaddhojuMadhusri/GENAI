This mind map has a central node "Artificial Intelligence" and three subgraphs representing Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Computer Vision. Each subgraph has a main node and several child nodes representing specific topics within that area. The edges connect the nodes in a hierarchical structure, showing the relationships between the topics.
